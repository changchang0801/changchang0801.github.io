            <strong>Narrative Structure</strong>
            This visualization project uses the interactive slideshow hybrid structure to guide users through
            various selected scenarios.
            Market exploration in different dimensions are displayed in each slide.
            Each slide can be navigated using arrows at left or right, or using the navigation dots on top, or use keyboard
            left and right buttons.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Visual Structure</strong>
            It starts with an overview using scatter plot followed by one histogram and area chart. Scatter plot is used
            to illustrated the relationship between house size and price, also bubble size depends on listing numbers.
            Histogram is used to how much are the listing charged distributed. While area plot displays the evolution of
            number of listings for different room types on the same chart, stacked on top of each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            There are 3 main scenes between the opening and ending scene and they are designed in consistent template
            and layout. The first scene is an overview of all cities' price, house size, as well as number of listing.
            And we dive deep in price distribution in second scene. And we look at the evolution along time in chart 3,
            which enable the users to review the past trend and look forward the future.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Tooltip is displayed in chart 1 when mouse hang over the dot.
            Trends and special attention needed are annotated using arrow and are commented in chart 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Chart 2 include a box for users to choose how many bins they want to break the histogram into.
            Chart 3 includes a legend on the right, it shows each group only when users hang mouse over the one interested.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Triggers</strong>
            Mouse over different cities in chart 1 will trigger the tooltip displayed and hidden.
            Key in number of bins in chart 2 will change chart 2 automatically.
            Mouse over different option of room type in chart 3 will trigger the chart change.

            The first scatter chart shows the positive relationship between average price and number of rooms of each
            city. And it's showed that San Jose has the largest number of listings Also Luxury neighborhood tends to have larger houses with higher prices in the listings, such as Los
            Gatos, Saratoga, Palo Alto.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take a closer look at price of the listings. How much are the listings charged?
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide" data-anchor="chart2">
        <h3>Distribution of the price</h3>
        <div class="chart chart2">
          <div id="svg2"></div>
          <p>
            <label># bins</label>
            <input type="number" min="1" max="100" step="20" value="20" id="nBin">

            The second histogram chart clearly shows that Price of the existing listings follows a long tail distribution.
            It's showed that most of the listings are within lower price range which is less than 300.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as you break down the buckets more granular, you can see more precise distribution since the histogram
            approaches density distribution .

      <div class="slide" data-anchor="chart3">
        <h3># of Listing of different room types</h3>

            The third area chart indicates that number of listings growth trend since 2009 to 2020. And more
            specifically, user can see the trend of each room type by hang over mouse on the room type list on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can see that the growth is super fast around year 2015. And it keeps growing after 2005 but at
            a slower pace. And the acceleration is much smaller for the most recent years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The market is now mostly private room and entire home, with fewer shared room and hotel room.
